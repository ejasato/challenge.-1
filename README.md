## Decription
This is challenge-1, 

-My motivation for this project is to get better at optimizing already made code.

-I rebuilt this project to utilize the tools in the first week of class to make the code easier to read and change.

-The problem I solved was to make the html and css code more legible and make it easier for someone to change the code if need be.
